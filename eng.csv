let P be the perimeter of each shape.
the area of each shape is:
‚Ä¢ circle: P¬≤/4œÄ
‚Ä¢ equilateral triangle: ‚àö3 P¬≤/36

* The type of the argument for `is_prime' should be `const int'. According to SO, it is good practice to use `const' for constants as in JavaScript.
* For reusability, `main' should be factored out to ""a function that returns a vector of primes &lt;= x"".","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1465703872165396486"
"2021-11-30 23:07:17","Next, let's write a program on prime numbers as a simple problem.
First, write a program to print prime numbers &lt;= 100.
An integer n &gt;= 2 is prime iff it is not divisible by any integer i where 2 &lt;= i &lt;= n - 1.
So the simplest code I can think of is: https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1465683858762842119/photo/1","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1465683858762842119"

According to SO, it's not bad to use `using namespace std' in source files (but not in header files), so I will always do so from now on. https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1465668803052728325/photo/1","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1465668803052728325"
