i've only found its utility in programming, but it may be useful in other areas as well.","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1618963319909646336"
"2023-01-27 22:21:41","i found ChatGPT to be great, esp bc i've never tried GitHub Copilot or any text-to-image AI, have no knowledge of basic algorithms, and only write elementary programs.","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1618962449176350720"
"2023-01-27 22:10:09","this is the code i had ChatGPT write a class to represent shogi in javascript.
i didn't say anything about the initial setup of shogi or the movement of the pieces, but it returned code that was only slightly wrong. https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1618959547170979841/photo/1","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1618959547170979841"

it returned the perfect code.

ChatGPT answered with a long explanation, ""(1/6) * (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) * (2/6) * (1/6) = (1/6)^6 = 0.0000213.""
this is wrong and inconsistent. the correct answer is 6!/6^6 = 0.0154....","https://x.com/yuuki26/status/1618953090698444801"

Conclusion: this is a great programming AI. i can no longer program without it.
i'm very impressed.

Mac Mini is silly. it's roughly the same size and weight as a MacBook but it has no display etc.
